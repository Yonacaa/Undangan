## Project Description

This project is for my own Metatah Ceremony (Balinese Traditional Tooth-Filing Ceremony). These code was mostly coded from scratch by myself. The styling was helped by Bootstrap CSS, the scroll-and-fade functionality was finetuned from ChatGPT-generated code, and the decoration animation was programmed using Anime.js.

*Name and location were changed to respect privacy. Name are fictional and location was just to be used as an example on how to view an embedded map.*

I got to tinker around with vanilla CSS when making the fade in animation of the text. It's been a while since the last time I **ngoprek** aka doing deep dive and tinkers code with vanilla CSS and JS.

Additionally, the sound and the graphics were also made by me, though the background image is a texture made from manipulating an image from Pixabay (I forgot which one exactly).

ðŸš§*Detailed breakdown of the code is still in construction.*ðŸš§
